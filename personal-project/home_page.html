                Ukrainian cuisine (Ukr. Українська кухня) is the traditional cuisine of the Ukrainian people, with a characteristic cooking style associated with Ukrainian culture. Ukrainian cuisine has evolved over many centuries. Throughout the territory of modern Ukraine, it remains quite homogeneous both in terms of the set of products used and the methods of their processing. Some of her dishes have become widespread among other peoples, especially Slavic, both eastern and western.

                    Each folk cuisine is primarily influenced by the design of the place where food is prepared, that is, the hearth.  For Ukrainians, such a place was "varista pich", a closed-type bonfire.  Therefore, Ukrainian cuisine mainly uses the methods of boiling, stewing and baking.  Even the Zaporizhian Cossacks, having shot game, tried to cook yushka (broth) out of it, and not roast it on a spit, which is more typical of the Germans, for example.

                        In addition, Ukrainian cuisine also adopted some technological methods from the cuisines of its neighbors, in particular, frying food in hot oil (oil), which is inherent in Tatar and Turkish cuisine.  Ground meat (“sicheniki”) was borrowed from German, and from Hungarian, for example, the use of paprika.
                       
                        The geographical and climatic conditions of the dwelling of the Ukrainian people were so diverse that they made it possible to eat both crop and livestock products.  Cattle breeding, hunting and fishing made the menu very diverse, although even before the beginning of the 19th century, meat dishes were considered festive among the people.
                       
                        The first cooks on the territory of modern Ukraine appeared in Kievan Rus in monasteries and at princely courts, that is, cooking became a separate specialty with a pronounced necessary skill.  Already in the 11th century, there were several cooks among the monks in the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra.  Cooks also appeared in wealthy families, where the female half had no time to cook.
                       
                    
                    Probably, it is the appearance of cooks in the monasteries of Kievan Rus that Ukrainian cuisine owes to the widespread use of eggs, which are used not only for preparing various kinds of scrambled eggs and omelettes, but also in religious pastries for the holidays and as an additive to various kinds of sweet flour, curd and egg-fruit dishes.
                        Thanks to the geographical (and, accordingly, culinary) discoveries of the 16th-18th centuries, a significant number of different cultivated plants appear on the territory of modern Ukraine, which enrich, expand and diversify the dishes of Ukrainian cuisine.  For example, in the 18th century, potatoes were widely distributed on the territory of modern Ukraine, which is used to prepare first courses, second courses and side dishes for fish and meat dishes.  Although this vegetable did not become a “second bread” among Ukrainians, unlike Belarusians, it has found wide application, and since that time, almost all first courses have been cooked with potatoes.

 In the 17th century, sunflower and mustard also appeared on the territory of modern Ukraine, which played an important role in the development of Ukrainian cuisine.  Sunflower oil is beginning to be widely used instead of imported Greek olive oil, and mustard is also used to make oil and seasonings for cold and hot meat dishes.

 And yet, finally formed in the form in which we know Ukrainian cuisine today, it can be called only by the 19th century, when tomatoes appeared.  In addition to them, Ukrainian cuisine at about the same time adopted other vegetables - blue eggplants, which were previously considered "Busurman" and were not eaten, as well as sugar beets, from which they began to produce sugar, which greatly enriched the national cuisine.  Sugar became available to the majority of the population due to its cheapness, which significantly expanded the range; sweet grandmothers, puddings, and cereals appeared on the menu.  The assortment of drinks has also expanded due to sweet liqueurs, varenukhs and similar things.

 Having common features, Ukrainian cuisine has its own regional characteristics.  There are at least Carpathian (Hutsul cuisine) cuisine, Lemko cuisine, Polissya cuisine, cuisine of central (Podneprovskaya) Ukraine.

Vareniki is a Ukrainian national dish in the form of boiled unleavened dough stuffed with boiled meat, vegetables, mushrooms, fruits, cottage cheese, potatoes and berries.  In the 19th century, vareniki were also known to the peasants of the Kursk province.  Similar to the Mari dish podkogylyo.

The dough for dumplings is made from wheat flour, it can be unleavened, yeast, on kefir.  It is rolled into a thin layer, from which round, oblique or square pieces are cut, and the filling is wrapped in them, which is used as chopped boiled meat with fried onions, stewed cabbage, boiled potatoes, cottage cheese;  or fresh berries: cherries, blueberries, strawberries.  Next, the edges of the dough are pinched, put in boiling water (or steamed) and boiled until they float (and plus another minute or two, depending on their size.

 Vareniki with meat or potatoes after cooking can also be fried in oil.  Vareniki with meat, unlike Russian vareniki, are stuffed with boiled meat.

 Served hot with sour cream and/or butter.  Sweet vareniki (cherry, cottage cheese) are often sprinkled with sugar or poured with honey.  Vareniki with meat and potatoes are usually served with fried onions and vegetable oil.

                    Syrniki (Ukrainian sirniki; from Ukrainian syr - cottage cheese), cottage cheese - a dish of Belarusian, Russian, Ukrainian and Moldovan cuisines in the form of fried cakes made from cottage cheese and flour.  The peculiarity of the recipe is that the cottage cheese must be carefully squeezed and rubbed (for example, through a sieve or in a blender): the better it is squeezed, the less flour is required to obtain a plastic dough.  Ideally, just a little bit of flour.  Cheesecakes are completely without flour, however, breaded and deep-fried.

 The most popular are simple cheesecakes and cheesecakes with raisins, but cheesecakes with other additives are also common, such as carrots, dried apricots, apples, pears, nuts, and potatoes.  In rare cases - green onions or dill.

 Cheesecakes are eaten with sour cream or fruit sauce based on fruit syrup, puree or marmalade.

 The word "cheese" in most Slavic languages   refers to various types of fermented milk products, including cottage cheese, but in Russian it soon ceased to be used in the latter sense.  The name "syrniki" is Ukrainianism in it, replacing the etymological "cottage cheese", see "syr".
