                <p class="paragraph1">Cheesecakes are almost my favorite food since childhood.  I still remember how my grandmother cooked them for me as a child, and this was one of the many reasons why I wanted to live with her.  It is also one of the first dishes that I myself learned to cook (under the guidance of my grandmother / mother) as a child.  And what then, what now is very simple.</p>

                        For kneading the dough, you will need a tablespoon and a bowl. Pour the cottage cheese there and break the eggs there. Stir until the eggs are mixed with the curd. Then add sugar and salt and stir again. Next comes flour, mix, and raisins, mix.

                        We fly vegetable oil into the pan and turn on the stove, while the oil is heating, we will prepare cheesecakes. First you need to prepare a flat plate with flour. We take the dough with our hands (hands need to be covered with flour, since the dough is wet and sticky), we form a sausage out of it, the length of the plate with flour and a diameter of 3.5-5 cm and roll in flour.  After that, cut into slices about a centimeter thick, roll in flour and put in a frying pan with heated oil. fry on one side until it turns golden and turn over. I want the syrniki to be cooked inside, so I put the syrniki out of the pan when both sides are golden and slightly light brown.

                        Serving is very simple. Put cheesecakes on a plate and put sour cream next to it. If there are no raisins and you want to make cheesecakes sweeter, then you can sprinkle them with sugar. Enjoy your meal.
